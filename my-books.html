          <h4>Let us C</h4>
          <p>
            This book is recommended to those who want to learn C programming
            language and there is no background of any language in their past.
            This was the first programming language books which I read. This is
            an awesome book if you want to start learning programming.

          <h4>Introduction to Algorithms</h4>
          <p>
            Narasimha Karumanch has explained the book in very effective manner
            and it takes from a basic beginner programming practices and puzzles
            of algorithm to the advance level. Now about Introduction to
            algorithm, it is also a very good book. The explanation is perfect
            and its advance concept is too good.
